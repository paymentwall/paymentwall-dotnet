# Code Samples

## Digital Goods API

#### Initializing Paymentwall
```
using Paymentwall;

Paymentwall_Base.setApiType(Paymentwall_Base.API_GOODS);
Paymentwall_Base.setAppKey("YOUR_PROJECT_KEY"); // available in your Paymentwall merchant area
Paymentwall_Base.setSecretKey("YOUR_SECRET_KEY"); // available in your Paymentwall merchant area
```

#### Widget Call
[Web API details](http://www.paymentwall.com/en/documentation/Digital-Goods-API/710#paymentwall_widget_call_flexible_widget_call)

The widget is a payment page hosted by Paymentwall that embeds the entire payment flow: selecting the payment method, completing the billing details, and providing customer support via the Help section. You can redirect the users to this page or embed it via iframe. Below is an example that renders an iframe with Paymentwall Widget.
```
List<Paymentwall_Product> productList = new List<Paymentwall_Product>();
Paymentwall_Product product = new Paymentwall_Product(
								"product301", // id of the product in your system
								9.99f, // price
								"USD", // currency code
								"Gold Membership", // product name
								Paymentwall_Product.TYPE_SUBSCRIPTION, // this is a time-based product; for one-time products, use Paymentwall_Product.TYPE_FIXED and omit the following 3 parameters
								1, // time duration
								Paymentwall_Product.PERIOD_TYPE_YEAR, // year
								true // recurring
							);
productList.Add(product);
Paymentwall_Widget widget = new Paymentwall_Widget(
	"user40012", // id of the end-user who's making the payment
	"p1_1", // widget code, e.g. p1; can be picked inside of your merchant account
	productList,
	new Dictionary<string, string>() {{"email", "user@hostname.com"}} // additional parameters
);
Response.Write(widget.getHtmlCode());
```

#### Pingback Processing

The Pingback is a webhook notifying about a payment being made. Pingbacks are sent via HTTP/HTTPS to your servers. To process pingbacks use the following code:
```
NameValueCollection parameters = Request.QueryString;
Paymentwall_Pingback pingback = new Paymentwall_Pingback(parameters, HttpContext.Current.Request.ServerVariables["REMOTE_ADDR"]);
if (pingback.validate())
{
	string productId = pingback.getProduct().getId();
	if (pingback.isDeliverable())
	{
		//deliver the product
	}
	else if (pingback.isCancelable())
	{
		//withdraw the product
	}
	Response.Write("OK"); // Paymentwall expects response to be OK, otherwise the pingback will be resent
}
else {                
	Response.Write(pingback.getErrorSummary());
}
```

## Virtual Currency API

#### Initializing Paymentwall

using Paymentwall;

Paymentwall_Base.setApiType(Paymentwall_Base.API_VC);

```

#### Widget Call

	"p1_1", // widget code, e.g. p1; can be picked inside of your merchant account
	new Dictionary<string, string>() {{"email", "user@hostname.com"}} // additional parameters
);
Response.Write(widget.getHtmlCode());
```

#### Pingback Processing

```
NameValueCollection parameters = Request.QueryString;
Paymentwall_Pingback pingback = new Paymentwall_Pingback(parameters, HttpContext.Current.Request.ServerVariables["REMOTE_ADDR"]);
if (pingback.validate())
{
	float virtualCurrency = float.Parse(pingback.getVirtualCurrencyAmount());
	if (pingback.isDeliverable())
	{
		// deliver the virtual currency
	} else 
	{
		// withdraw the virtual currency
	}
	Response.Write("OK"); // Paymentwall expects response to be OK, otherwise the pingback will be resent
}
else {
	Response.Write(pingback.getErrorSummary());
}
```

## Cart API

#### Initializing Paymentwall
```
using Paymentwall;

Paymentwall_Base.setApiType(Paymentwall_Base.API_CART);
Paymentwall_Base.setAppKey("YOUR_PROJECT_KEY"); // available in your Paymentwall merchant area

List<Paymentwall_Product> productList = new List<Paymentwall_Product>();
productList.AddRange(
	new List<Paymentwall_Product>() {
		new Paymentwall_Product("product301", 3.33f, "EUR"), //first product on cart
		new Paymentwall_Product("product607", 7.77f, "EUR") //second product on cart
	}
);
Paymentwall_Widget widget = new Paymentwall_Widget(
	"user40012", // id of the end-user who's making the payment
	"p1_1", // widget code, e.g. p1; can be picked inside of your merchant account
	productList,
	new Dictionary<string, string>() {{"email", "user@hostname.com"}} // additional parameters
);
Response.Write(widget.getHtmlCode());
```

#### Pingback Processing

```
NameValueCollection parameters = Request.QueryString;
Paymentwall_Pingback pingback = new Paymentwall_Pingback(parameters, HttpContext.Current.Request.ServerVariables["REMOTE_ADDR"]);
if (pingback.validate())
{
	List<Paymentwall_Product> products = pingback.getProducts();
	if (pingback.isDeliverable())
	{
		// deliver products from the cart
	} else 
	{
